This folder contains the supplementary files from Escherichia coli pangenome analysis.
The detail for each file is described below.

Supplementary File 1.txt
Dataset characteristics of the 1,624 E. coli complete genomes. This includes NumChromosomal (number of chromosomal sequences), NumPlasmid (number of plasmid sequences), NumExtraChromosomal (number of extra chromosomal sequences), Length_DNA (length of DNA sequences), NumProteins (number of protein sequences), GC (GC content), SequenceType, Phylogroup, Serotype and Remarks.

Supplementary File 2.txt
Pangenome matrix of E. coli based on CD-HIT method. The gene families (GFs) are represented on rows and the genomes are represented on columns. There are 25,420 GFs with 1,324 genomes. The entry 1 represents presence and 0 represents absence.

Supplementary File 2A.txt
The details of E. coli pangenome matrix based on CD-HIT method which includes the number of species (genomes) and number of genes for each gene family. The list of protein accession ID for each GF in each genome is given accordingly with each protein accession ID tagged with the genome accession ID as suffix.

Supplementary File 2B.txt
The list of gene families (GFs) which belong to the softcore genome of E. coli identified through CD-HIT method. 

Supplementary File 3.txt
Pangenome matrix of E. coli based on ProteinOrtho method. The gene families (GFs) are represented on rows and the genomes are represented on columns. There are 24,889 GFs with 1,324 genomes. The entry 1 represents presence and 0 represents absence.

Supplementary File 3A.txt
The details of E. coli pangenome matrix based on ProteinOrtho method which includes the number of species (genomes) and number of genes for each gene family. The list of protein accession ID for each GF in each genome is given accordingly with each protein accession ID tagged with the genome accession ID as suffix.

Supplementary File 3B.txt
The list of gene families (GFs) which belong to the softcore genome of E. coli identified through ProteinOrtho method. 

Supplementary File 4.xlsx
The list of gene families (GFs) selected which show distinctive profile in different sequence types and phylotypes of E. coli. There are six worksheets in the file which can be categorized into (1) Rare in ST11; (2) Common in B2; (3) Common in ST131; (4) Rare in ST131; (5) B1-Shiga; and (6) Common in ST11. The list of GFs are given together with the gene name as well as description accordingly.

Supplementary File 5.txt
The number of virulence factors (Count_Virulence) and antibiotic resistant genes (Count_Antibiotic) present in the 1,324 E. coli genomes. The sequence type and phylogroup of each genome is given to facilitate analysis.

Supplementary File 6.txt
The antibiogram matrix (24 antibiotics) with 1 represent resistant and 0 represent sensitive as predicted by ResFinder v4.1 for the 1,324 E. coli genomes. 

Supplementary File 7.txt
The virulence factor matrix (177 virulence factors) with 1 represents presence and 0 represents absence as predicted by virulencefinder v2.0.3 for the 1,324 E. coli genomes.
